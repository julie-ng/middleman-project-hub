A boilerplate I use when creating middleman sites.


### Organization

I organized my css, images and js into their own assets folder like so:

  * `/sources/assets/css/`
  * `/sources/assets/images/`
  * `/sources/assets/js/`

### Layout

There is also some basic layout:

  * Header
  * Footer (sticky)
  * Navigation - generated via `data/navigation.yml` file
